Welcome to Promise It Wonâ€™t Hurt! -- an automated workshop explaining how 
to use promises effectively in both browser- and server-side JavaScript.

This module is built on the workshopper module originally extracted from 
stream-adventure.

This workshop was originally created as an introduction to Q, but has since
evolved into one for ES2015 promises.

Several other promise modules that are popular and more or less compatible
with ES2015 are listed below:
